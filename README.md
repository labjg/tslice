# tslice
Create time-slice images with Python

Prerequisites:
- NumPy
- imageio

The class 'TimeSlice' in 'tslice.py' is constructed with a directory path which should contain a sequence of photos in name-order. Other options are explained within the code itself.

You can create time-slices from all or some of your photos (skipping every n images if you decide there are too many) Linear slices running left-to-right, top-to-bottom, right-to-left, and bottom-to-top are all possible. Again, see the code.

A full example ('example.py') is included which, if you simply execute it, should make things fairly clear.

Blod post on the motivations for this:

Please feel free to get in touch with your time-slices. I'd love to see what people come up with.
